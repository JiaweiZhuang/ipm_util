# Python utilities for Integrated Performance Monitoring (IPM)

IPM (https://github.com/nerscadmin/IPM) is a lightweight MPI profiler. IPM itself is great and very easy to use, but the post-processing of profiling results is a bit cumbersome: the original Perl-based script `ipm_parse` is not easy to extend; plots are generated by the legacy `ploticus` tool and look too old to publish on modern journals.

I wrote some Python scripts to parse IPM's XML log file into Pandas Dataframes, to allow easy exploration & visualization of profiling results in Python.

## Usage

Install:

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/JiaweiZhuang/ipm_util.git

Demo: See [./examples](./examples)

## Limitations

Currently assumes `IPM_LOG=terse` (per-rank, per MPI function type). Not tested with `IPM_LOG=full` yet (per MPI function call, per message size).
